# Park Tripper

Tired of planning your trip based on a boring old map? Use your eyes! Pick national parks to visit based on gorgeous pictures of America's gracious skies and amber waves of grain, hand picked by our nation's finest park rangers and served up from an API.

## Technologies

Also I would like to do these things
* I want to have a map charting a route for me to visit those parks
* I want to be able to select a State and look at just their 
    national parks and then plan a trip
* Improved visual experience for the user
* make it more mobile friendly
